## DDLoader Mod Manager (for Muck, Hollow Knight, Havendock, and Regions of Ruin!)

This is a project I've spent admittedly way too much time on for what it is, but it's been very useful for developing mods so far.
It's a tool that allows you to delete, enable or disable mods from the game's mod folder without having to manually move them around,
and it has the added benefit of having quick access to the game's mod folder, as well as buttons to easily install console commands and unity-explorer!
Installs bepinex in the blink of an eye, allowing for quick removal in the case of borking something, or quick installation for those who
aren't as comfortable moving files around themselves!
